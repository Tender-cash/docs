title: "Getting API Credentials"
description: "Generate and manage your Tender API credentials for authentication"

## Overview

Tender uses HMAC-based authentication to secure API requests. You'll need two credentials:

1. **Access ID** - Your public API identifier
2. **Access Secret** - Your private key for signing requests

<Warning>
  Never share your Access Secret or commit it to version control. Treat it like a password.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized Error" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Incorrect Access ID or Secret
    - Invalid HMAC signature
