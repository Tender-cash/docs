Below are essential terms you'll encounter while integrating Tender. Understanding these will help ensure smooth implementation, testing, and reconciliation of transactions.

## Authentication & Security

#### Access ID

A public credential used to identify your account when making API requests. This identifier is passed in the `x-access-id` header with every request.

#### Access Secret

A private credential used for signing and verifying API requests. You must use your secret to generate HMAC signatures for authentication. Never share this key or commit it to version control.

#### Signing Requests

Tender requires all API requests to be signed using HMAC-SHA256 with your Access Secret. This ensures that requests are legitimate and have not been tampered with during transmission.

## Environments

We have two environments in Tender:

| Environment    | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Test**       | A sandbox environment used during development and testing. It allows developers to simulate payment flows and API interactions using testnet cryptocurrencies. No actual funds are processed.                |
| **Production** | The live environment where real cryptocurrency transactions occur. It processes actual payments on mainnet blockchains and should only be accessed with secure, verified credentials.                        |

## Payments

#### Agent

A sub-business or merchant account that can receive cryptocurrency payments independently. Agents have their own wallet addresses and can be managed through the Tender API.

#### Payment Initiation

The process of creating a new cryptocurrency payment request. Returns a wallet address where the customer can send funds on their chosen blockchain.

#### Chain

A blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, BSC) where cryptocurrency transactions are processed. Tender supports multiple chains for flexibility.

#### Coin/Currency

The specific cryptocurrency used for payment (e.g., USDT, USDC, ETH). Each chain may support multiple currencies.

#### Fiat Currency

Traditional government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity but by the government that issued it (e.g., USD, EUR, NGN, GBP). In Tender's context, fiat currencies are used as the base currency for pricing and conversions. When initiating a payment by fiat currency, you specify the amount in fiat (e.g., $100 USD), and Tender calculates the equivalent cryptocurrency amount based on current exchange rates.

#### Transaction Validation

The confirmation of a cryptocurrency payment after it has been broadcast and confirmed on the blockchain. Returns the transaction status and details.

## Integration Terms

#### Webhook

A real-time notification sent to your server when certain events occur (e.g., transaction completed, payment failed). Webhooks are configured with a callback URL and optional custom headers.

#### Callback URL

The endpoint on your system where Tender sends webhook events. It must be accessible over HTTPS and respond with a 2xx status code.

#### Exchange Rate

The conversion rate between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies (e.g., USDT to USD). Tender provides real-time exchange rate data through the API.

#### Request ID

A unique identifier (UUID) for each API request, passed in the `x-request-id` header. Used for request tracking and idempotency.

#### Timestamp

The Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) when a request is made, passed in the `x-timestamp` header. Used as part of the HMAC signature generation.

---

## Blockchain Terms

#### Wallet Address

A unique cryptographic address on a blockchain where cryptocurrency can be received. Each agent has wallet addresses for supported chains.

#### Confirmation

The number of blocks added to the blockchain after a transaction is included. More confirmations mean higher security and finality.

#### Gas Fee

The transaction fee paid to blockchain validators/miners for processing a transaction. Gas fees vary by network and congestion.

#### Testnet

A parallel blockchain network used for testing without using real cryptocurrency. Useful for development and integration testing.

#### Mainnet

The primary blockchain network where real transactions with actual value occur. Used in production environments.
