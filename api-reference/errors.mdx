Tender follows follows the conventional HTTP status codes. Code in the range of 2xx indicate success, while codes in the range of 4xx indicates that the request failed as a result of the something provided in the request data. And codes in the range 5xx are unexpected server errors.

## Error envelope

On error, responses are wrapped in the same envelope shape as successful responses:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "human readable description",
  "data": null
}
```

Some endpoints may include additional fields in `data` with more context about the failure.

## HTTP status codes

| Code | Name                 | Description                                                                            |
| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200  | OK                   | Request succeeded.                                                                     |
| 201  | Created              | Request succeeded and a new resource was created.                                      |
| 202  | Accepted             | Request accepted for processing (e.g. webhook fetch / logs).                           |
| 400  | Bad Request          | The request is malformed or missing required parameters.                               |
| 401  | Unauthorized         | Authentication failed – missing, invalid, or expired credentials / signature.          |
| 403  | Forbidden            | Authenticated, but not allowed to access this resource.                                |
| 404  | Not Found            | Resource does not exist or is not visible to this merchant.                            |
| 409  | Conflict             | Conflicting request (for example, duplicate action on the same resource).              |
| 422  | Unprocessable Entity | Payload validation error – fields are present but invalid.                             |
| 429  | Too Many Requests    | Rate limit exceeded; back off and retry later.                                         |
| 5xx  | Server Error         | Unexpected error while processing the request – retry with backoff if appropriate.     |

## Working with validation errors

When you receive a `400` or `422` response, check:

- The request body matches the documented schema (field names and types).
- Path parameters (for example, `:id`, `:currency`, `:coin`) are present and valid.
- Authentication headers from the **Authentication** section are correctly set.

Fix the offending fields and retry the request. If errors persist with a seemingly correct
payload, capture the full response body and contact support.*** End Patch
